# Software Testing Project 
## Web & Mobile Application Testing  

## 📌 About the Project

The goal of the project is to evaluate the quality of two real-world systems:

- 🌐 Web Application: https://apk-rks.net  
- 📱 Mobile Application: SIVIG (Sigma Insurance Company)

The project includes structured software testing processes covering both functional and non-functional testing.

## 🎯 Testing Objectives

- Verify core system functionalities  
- Identify functional and non-functional defects  
- Evaluate system performance under load  
- Assess security mechanisms  
- Test usability and user experience  
- Document findings professionally  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Apache JMeter – Load & Stress Testing  
- Nmap – Security Testing
- Microsoft Excel – Test Case management (STLC-based)  
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari  
- iOS mobile device for mobile application testing

# 🌐 Web Application Testing (apk-rks.net)

## 1️⃣ Functional Testing
- Navigation verification  
- Forms and validation testing  
- Search and filtering functionality  
- Document download testing

## 2️⃣ Integration Testing

- News module filtering (Frontend–Backend via AJAX)  
- “Sinjalizimi” reporting form workflow  
- Data validation and step-by-step persistence

## 3️⃣ Performance Testing

Testing performed using Apache JMeter.

| Test Type     | Users Tested        | Result                           |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Load Testing  | 100 users           | < 2 sec response time, 0% errors |
| Stress Testing| up to 1500 users    | 0.07% error rate                 |

## 4️⃣ Security Testing

- Port scanning with Nmap  
- SQL Injection testing
